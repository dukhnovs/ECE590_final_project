# ECE590_final_project

## Project Goals:
I will use Elma in C++ to create one or more examples of how to use it.

## Project Success:
I will deliver at least one working example of an Elma implementation. My example will include a plot of data that was collected by Elma.

## Example #1:
1) Pull weather data on a set interval. Collect the data. Plot the data. Email a weather report when enough data is collected.
2) Same thing as the weather example, but maybe I will find more interesting data instead of weather.

## Project Resources
 - Weather API from: https://openweathermap.org/api
 - Visual Studio Code with C++

## Stretch Goals:
1) Expand Example #1. For instance, create an event to post either the weather report or just a summary of the weather on twitter or other social networks.
2) Create Example #2.
