# ECE590_final_project

## Project Goals:
I will use Elma in C++ to create one or more examples of how to use it.

## Project Success:
I will deliver at least one working example of an Elma implementation. My example will include a plot of data that was collected by Elma.

## Example #1:
1) Pull weather data on a set interval. Collect the data. Plot the data. Email a weather report when enough data is collected.
2) Same thing as the weather example, but maybe I will find more interesting data instead of weather.

## Project Resources
 - Weather API from: https://openweathermap.org/api
 - Visual Studio Code with C++

## Stretch Goals:
1) Expand Example #1. For instance, create an event to post either the weather report or just a summary of the weather on twitter or other social networks.
2) Create Example #2.

## Milestones / Planned Date of Achievement
1) Create a GitHub repository for the final project. / 3.10.19
2) Create code to pull one sample of weather data. / 3.16.19
3) Create class to pull data on an interval and store it. / 3.17.19
4) Create code to plot stored data. / 3.17.19
5) Create code to send plot or report to an email address triggered by some event. / 3.17.19
6) Finish documentatation. / 3.22.19
7) Work on stretch goals. / 3.22.19
8) Completing the final project and submitting it by pushing to GitHub. / 3.22.19

## HW 9 Problem 3: Accomplishments This Week (3.17.19)
1) Created a GitHub repository for the final project. (Milestone #1)
2) Signed up for an account at https://home.openweathermap.org/ (Not a Milestone)
3) Obtained API key and tested it but it will take 24 hours before it can be activated. (Not a Milestone)
4) Used "elma_project" repo (https://github.com/klavinslab/elma_project) to convert my repo to a new extended example. (Not a Milestone)
5) Created code to pull one sample of weather data. (Milestone #2)

## HW 9 Problem 4: New Code that Worked This Week (3.17.19)
1) My unit_test.cc file shows an example of how to get one sample of weather data which was Milestone #2.
